## The Problem 
 - **3.6 million** citizens have left the country, another **7+ million** have been displaced inside the country, since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
 - Most refugees and survivors of forced displacement will not receive needed **mental health care** due to scarcity of services, lack of access to qualified care and stigma against mental disorders.
 - The APA _American Psychological Association_ estimates that mental disorders **affect up to 80%** of the refugees. Systematic reviews show that by far the most common are : 
   - Depression  ~44%
   - Anxiety  ~40%
   - PTSD  ~36% _(Post Traumatic Stress Disorder)_
